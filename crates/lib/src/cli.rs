        Note on Rollbacks and the `/etc` Directory:

        When you perform a rollback (e.g., with `bootc rollback`), any
        changes made to files in the `/etc` directory won't carry over
        to the rolled-back deployment.  The `/etc` files will revert
        to their state from that previous deployment instead.

        This is because `bootc rollback` just reorders the existing
        deployments. It doesn't create new deployments. The `/etc`
        merges happen when new deployments are created.
